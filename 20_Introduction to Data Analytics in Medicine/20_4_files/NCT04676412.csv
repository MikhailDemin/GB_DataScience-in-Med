The primary study hypotheses are that: 1) the combination of pembrolizumab and lenvatinib is superior to pembrolizumab alone as assessed by Progression-free Survival (PFS) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1); and 2) the combination of pembrolizumab and lenvatinib is superior to pembrolizumab alone as assessed by Overall Survival (OS).",YES,Non-small Cell Lung Cancer,BIOLOGICAL: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Lenvatinib|DRUG: Placebo for lenvatinib,"Progression-free Survival (PFS) Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) as Assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR), PFS was defined as the time from date of randomization to the date of the first documentation of progressive disease (PD) or death from any cause, whichever occurred first. Per RECIST 1.1, PD was defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of ≥5 mm.
