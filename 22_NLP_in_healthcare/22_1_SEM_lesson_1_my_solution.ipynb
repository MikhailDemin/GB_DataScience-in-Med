    "Даты выражаются по-разному. В России дата обычно выражается в формате **`дд-ММ-гг`**; в то время как в США он обычно выражается в формате **`ММ-дд-гггг`**. Иногда люди также используют сокращения месяцев, например **`aug`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Цель этого задания — помочь вам познакомиться с регулярными выражениями (или «регулярными выражениями») и применить свои знания к реальным данным. Вы сможете:\n",
    "  - Используйте регулярные выражения для извлечения дат в различных форматах из текста.\n",

    "  - Предположим, что все даты в формате **`xx/xx/xx`** имеют формат **`мм/дд/гг`**.\n",
    "  - Предположим, что даты в формате **`xx/xx`** равны **`мм/гг`**.\n",
    "  - Предположим, что все даты, где год закодирован только двумя цифрами, относятся к 1900-м годам (например, `05.01.89` — это `5 января 1989 года`).\n",
    "  - Если день отсутствует (например, «9/2009»), предположим, что это первый день месяца (например, «1 сентября 2009 года»).\n",
    "  – Если месяц отсутствует (например, «2010»), предположим, что это первое января этого года (например, «1 января 2010 года»).\n",
