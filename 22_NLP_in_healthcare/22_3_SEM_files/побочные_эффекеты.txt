1	extreme weight gain, short-term memory loss, hair loss.
2	COMPLETELY DESTROYED SEXUALLY FUNCTIONING .
3	Just TWO tablets of Lexapro 10mg completely destroyed my sexual functioning, probably for life.
4	It's called PSSD: post-SSRI sexual dysfunction.
5	And there is a chance that it will give you PSSD, which as the name suggests persists even after you stop taking the drug, Just google 'PSSD' and you'll see what I mean, So please: NEVER take this drug, not even one tablet.
6	Nausea, Blurred Vision, 3 to 5 hours sleep, Suicidal Thoughts.
7	I was unable to sleep, had blurred vision, and felt sick to my stomach.
8	Unable to eat anything significant for the 3 days.
9	While driving to a friends house crazy thoughts kept happening.
10	Would not have been able to work (software developer) if attempting this drug during work week.
11	First 10 days were HORRIBLE, like a looong panic attack with anxiety/nausea.
12	It calmed down when I got some Xanor for three weeks (was still worse than before lexapro though), after that back to lots of anxiety, derealisation, nausea etc, Also couldn't sleep much, woke at 6.30am with horrible anxiety no matter when I fell asleep the day before.
13	My anxiety is worse than before, and I've been getting more and more dizzy by the week .
14	the last three weeks I haven't been able to watch TV since it makes me feel nauseus, and I haven't been outside in two weeks due to the dizziness!
15	The last week or two I've been feeling nausea all day, mostly due to the dizziness, Everyone's different though, and you should probably give it a try, others are having luck.
16	Chronic cough, weight gain, no sexual interest.
17	Emergency Room visit with tachycardia and violent vertigo.
18	That quickly turned into a three week period of sleep.
19	I was unable to hold my body vertical.
20	Slept through life and gained weight.
21	After the third day at that dose I found myself in the ER with vertigo, dizziness, tachycardia, dry mouth, nausea, and a host of other complaints.
22	The vertigo is rendering me unable to function in daily life causing me to lose work.
23	I am seeing a specialist for the vertigo and undergoing testing which now I have been diagnosed with vestibular neurontitis.
24	My vertigo has not responded to conservative treatment thus far.
25	Muscle spasms, muscle twitching, muscle soreness, insomnia, mental confusion, flush, brain zaps.
26	I took Lexapro for 3 days in 10mg doses and had severe side effects immediately.
27	I'm sorry this is more about not taking it than about side effects of taking it.
28	"I was given samples today and took one dose before coming to this site, where I learned that insomnia and decreased libido are serious side effects for many people; these are already major, major issues for me, By now, the first feelings of ""tightness"" in my head, dry mouth, and a little bit of jitters have begun."
29	As a result surely of prior conditions, but I do feel in part because of the drug or its jittery side effects, I've been unable to stop weeping for the past hour.
30	Extreme Weight Gain 30 pounds.
31	Excessive perspiration, Erectile dysfunction.
32	Almost no libido at all, Utterly useless.
33	Took a while to have an effect on mood obviously,but side-effects alarming:sudden migraines which I had had very infrequently before.

35	Have your blood pressure checked even if like me, you have never had a problem with it you may be in for a nasty surprise!
36	Heavy sedation, Jaw Clenching, Inability to organism.
37	Very bad side effects.
38	emotionless, Zombie effect.
39	Loss of memory.
40	"When i took lexapro i walked around in a ""zombie"" like state because i would never be happy about anything, but never really sad."
41	I just kind of felt numb toward all emotion, Also, my memory started lacking and i couldnt remember long periods of time or things i had done.
42	i still have difficulty remembering most of that year and for no particular reason.
43	Jaw jacking/clenching teeth, headaches, vomitting, waking up in the middle of the night for hours, increase in anxiety, blurred vision.
44	I started feeling the side effects the fist day i took 10mg.
45	Crazy dreams and visions, slight insomnia, my teeth are killing me from grinding them and I guess that caused my headaches.
46	Can hardly even read and feel like I'm in a fog or that I'm stoned.
47	Clumsy and at first gave me tons of energy but I think that was the increased anxiety.
48	About four hours after my dose it's like I went downhill, my head got very heavy, and that was the foggy state.
49	I haven't noticed any positive changes and the side effects are horrible.
50	The increase in anxiety has made me stop taking this pill.
51	Fatigue, dizziness, apathy, muscle jerks, jaw clenching, interfered with Thyroid replacement medicine, insomnia.
52	I took this for two months, hoping that the side effects would ease.

59	if you are an othewise phyically healthy human you may risk compromising the proper functioning of the T-cells which may have UKNOWN consequences, the worst being autoimmunce disease which will make you very sick with flu-like symptoms and unable to get better,please beware.
60	"The risks of such dangerous and hidden physiological side effects are in NO WAY worth the potential positive effects of so-called subjective ""mental stability"" which is merely illusory and masks the hidden danger."
61	Heart burn.
62	I had to take a heart burn relief medication each day I took Lexapro.
63	I had pain all over my body!
64	My legs were the worst and my left leg felt like it was on fire!
65	It hurt so bad, I ended up in the E,R.
66	my arms felt like needles are poking them, Felt like a knife in my shoulder, I got chills easily, felt like my legs were not getting enough circulation, it felt like my blood had carbonation in it!
67	This is the most awful feeling!
68	I am still having aches, pains, pins and needles throughout my entire body after being off of the Lexapro for a few days.
69	Weight gain, HAIR LOSS, increased depression, fatigue, lethargy.
70	I switched from Cymbalta to Lexapro and after approximately 30 days, I began feeling very bad.
71	I gained 13 lbs in 6 weeks and could not get out of bed after 60 days.
72	My hair started falling out by the handful.
73	Reduced cognition, fatigue, addiction.
74	The med was okay until side effects had negative impacts and it was extremely difficult to get off of.
75	From the moment I swallowed this pill I experienced a dry mouth and dry eyes.
76	But more alarming was the sensation of pressure behind my eyes-like they were going to pop out!
77	Also I had a severe inablility to concentrate which made it impossible to do my job,I am a Registered Nurse.
78	I also found myself making a bizarre sucking motion with my mouth-possibly from the dryness?
79	Disturbed sleep, exhaustion, nausea, dizzyness, jaw-clenching and increased anxiety.
80	It's been four days since I discontinued, and I'm still wiped out and dizzy with flu-like symptoms.
81	Everyone is different, but for me Lexapro was like some kind of torture device, Can't wait for it to leave my system.
82	1)  After two to three hours vomit 2)  Stiff muscles (Lack of oxygen?)
83	3)  Spacey, out of sync with time (as in Where did that tree come from?
84	4)  Weird, (as in How did that tree get there?
85	), 5)  Weak muscles 6)  Cant catch breath 7)  Listless 8)  Unmotivated 9)  Difficulty getting moving 10)  Reaction time slowed, [as in Put your hand on your solar plexus (Huh?
86	11)  Forgetful, stupid (its Sunday, right?)
87	12)  Depressed (as in Whats the use?).
88	suidical feelings.
89	I took this medication for a month before I started getting extreme suicidal feelings, which I had not had before taking it.
90	Racing heart, severe anxiety, panic, nausea, speeded-up metabolism.
91	It was brilliant for 2 weeks, except for some queasiness.
92	But into the 3rd week I began to wake in the night with very scary heart palpitations.
93	After a few nights of this (while feeling good during the day), the palpitations and subsequent panic were still there in the morning and continued throughout the day.
94	and I still have occasional heart flutters, a clenched stomach, and the anxiety that goes with that.
95	I also think Lexapro and alcohol were a bad mix for me.
96	jittery, disconnected feelings, suicidal thoughts, unable to function.
97	I took one dose of this med and was lucky to be able to drive home from work.
98	Suicidal thoughts when I had NEVER had those thoughts before, Super scary.
99	Insomnia, irregular heartbeat, anxiety times 1000, suicidal depression.
100	I'm in serious pain right now.
101	I'm about to go to the hospital cause this drug is killing me.
102	vivid nightmares, sweats, higher anxiety levels, memory problems, concentration problems, teeth grinding and clenching of jaws.
103	I was taking 10 mg. After a lifetime of perfect dental checkups and having beautiful teeth, I now have 50 percent bone loss in my jaw because of the teeth grinding.
104	It's signifigant to note that I had been wearing a night guard that was supposed to protect the teeth during this past year.
105	Not worth the side effects.
106	Constant yawning,severe tremors,headache, lost all sex drive the first day, couldn't orgasm if I tried, terrible jaw clenching, helped somewhat with social anxiety, but general anxiety got worse, panic attacks increased,.
107	The sexual side effects were supposed to be countered by the Welly, Didn't happen.
108	I have not had sex for 6 months which is putting a strain on the relationship.
109	dry mouth, severe thirst, hot flashes all over my body, tightness in my chest, severe diahrea, fuzzy mind, freaquent urination, lost 25 pounds in two weeks, muscle aches, flu like symptons, stomach cramps and tiredness.
110	i experienced all these symptoms after just one 10mg pill and still sufering the side effects two weeks later.
111	i have noticed increases in my headaches, the front of my brain burns and i've noticed an increase in suicidal thoughts and anxiety.
112	extreme lethargy; hungry more than usual; weight gain; zero motivation; memory issues (short term memory negatively affected); hopeless; social anxiety magnified.
113	I took 10 mg for one month and mainly noticed the fatigue as the biggest side effect, once I was upped to 20 mg though all of the other side effects seemed to take hold of my life.
114	I didn't take Lexapro long enough to evaluate it for its intended purpose, because I found the sexual side effects intolerable.
115	I not only lost the ability to orgasm, but stopped having even the slightest feelings of arousal.
116	Near the end of the two weeks I could feel my frustration as a sort of dull, heavy ache in my stomach, but I couldn't do anything about it because I was basically numb, a nonsexual being.
117	I've heard great things about what this drug can do for depression, but the side effects are a real possibility.
118	Increased anxiety, SERIOUS constipation (for which even laxatives and epsom salts barely helped) and stomach cramping, my stomach hurt all the time, disturbed sleep and trouble falling asleep, fatigue, headaches.
119	I couldn't get past the side effects- have no idea if it would've worked for me.
120	suicidal thoughts, mood swings, difficulty to concentrate.
121	GAINED ONE POUND A WEEK for six months, Yep, 30 POUNDS.
122	Been off of it for eight months, now bigger, have high BP and pre-diabetes because of the weight gain.
123	Before I got any fatter, I stopped taking it and my metabolism is MESSED UP.
124	I eat so much less than I used to, and still can't seem to lose the weight I gained while on Lexapro.
125	I'd rather be normal sized and anxious than overweight, taking BP meds and insulin medication!
126	Lack of care for anything important in my life.
127	Lack of feeling for anything, just lived day by day.
128	Inability to Ejaculate during sex.

130	"Nausea (for about 1 week), headaches, brain ""zaps"" occasionally, extreme sleepiness, vivid dreams, loss of sex drive."
131	Went to 20mg after some really tough life circumstances, Side-effects were unmanageable!
132	Possible loss of libido.

134	I do not think Lexapro gave me any seriously adverse side effects.
135	"nausea, dizziness, spaciness, lack of coordination, massive headache in morning that lasts all day, feeling generally ""hungover"", lack of energy/motivation, dry mouth, jaw clenching, Dr. prescribed this to ""give me a better outlook, engergy, and be able to face the day"" because of depression related to death of parents/divorce/job cut/ and resulting overwhelming responsibilities related to those factors."

182	Extreme fatigue, difficulty waking up, emotional numbness/detachment, inability to concentrate, forgetfulness, lack of interest in ANYTHING except sleep, inability to reach orgasm with a partner, weakness, excessive urination, dizziness.

189	At one point I wanted to kill myself.
190	Fatigue .
191	I was tired, and felt extra exhausted all the time.

195	increased anxiety, more panic attacks, uncontrollably bursting into tears.
196	i started at 5 mgs, felt like i was on speed for the first few days.
197	2 weeks later the anxiety had increased into panic, the Dr. had me skip a day then start back at 2.5 mgs daily.
198	that was ok for about 3 days then i started having constant panic/anxiety, as well as crying a lot at innappropriate times.

220	Sleepless nights also with vivid dreams in the first week as well.
221	Now in week two, just general tiredness through out the day[eventhough I switched from taking it in the am to in the pm before bed, which did help a bit with tiredness], decrease in hunger, and low to no sex-drive

223	finally attributing to lexapro, atleast at this dosage/ Very apathetic and have gained 20lbs easily.
224	muscle and joint pain.
225	Duno but i need my brain back!
226	At first, all the usual (dry mouth, dry eyes, tight jaw, dizziness, stoned feeling, nausea) but they went away after a month.
227	Then after a few months, more serious effects that I now believe were from the Lexapro started, like all-over itching and severe middle back pain, especially at night and upon waking in AM.
228	Now I have terrible acne and infected cysts under one arm and might go off it all together to see if connected.
229	I did go off for a month and the inappropriate anger came right back so now I'm thinking of switching to another SSRI that doesn't cause back pain, cysts and itching, not to mention wanting to sleep 13 hours a night.
230	Lack of motivation, VERY TIRED all the time, memory loss-feel scatter brained.
231	I feel so tired all the time that I don't have the energy to do basic every day household tasks.

234	I also have difficulty remembering things and feel scatterbrained.
235	I will think of something that I need to do and less than a minute later I have forgotten what it was that I needed to do.
236	I would like to try a different antidepressant because the loss of motivation and being tired all the time is making me feel lazy, worthless, and almost as depressed as before I started taking it.
237	Initially, Lexapro seemed to agree with me except for the occasional bad nightmare, Now, after 4 years of use, I am no longer depressed, but I am exhausted all the time.
238	I spend most of my spare time in bed sleeping .
239	I'm barely participating in life.
241	Normally my waist is 10-12 inches smaller than my hips, but now it is about 5 inches smaller.

249	I feel that I don't have passion about anything in my life.
250	It's like not having emotions at all.
251	WEIGHT Gain, complete loss of libido.
252	I was so excited to start it as I was on Effexor for years but it had negative effects on my BP.
253	And I gained 24 pounds, have no sexual desire and still have moody days.
254	Just switched to Pristiq and hope to get rid of weight and regain sexual desire.

258	Clenching my jaw has gotten worse since I've been on it.
259	I feel like I want to go run or jump up and down or something to get rid of this excess energy.
260	I feel really strange but am hoping I even out some after being on it for awhile.
261	I also had some really strange images while trying to go to sleep last night.
262	I wasn't asleep so I can't call it a dream/nightmare, but definitely strange nonetheless.

264	slight nausea and shakiness and feeling very anxious particularly in the morning.
265	Diarrhea, inability to orgasm, loss of sexual pleasure, significant weight gain, withdrawal was not pleasant.
266	The first 6 weeks there was a lot of running to the bathroom .

273	I haven't had a good night's sleep in a year because of the night sweats.
274	Alcohol-related blackouts, super-intense dreams, sleepy, nervous.
275	Worked really well first six months or so for my depression but after several freaky alcohol incidents where I drank 3-4 glasses of wine and then blacked out completely, I cut down my dosage from 20 to 10 mg and plan to go back on Welbutrin at my next doctor's consult.
276	I have never had more interesting dreams than those I had on Lexipro .
277	I'll miss those: very detailed, vivid, fascinating, cinematic-like dreams, Amazing, But, my friends complained that I acted completely out of character when I drank, and I don't remember anything I said or did, so I've decided this isn't right for me.
278	My blood pressure rose more than 10 points after taking the first Lexapro 10 mg. My normal BP is about 110/70, it rose to 134/88)  I cut down to 5 mg, and my blood pressure stayed at about 124/84 until about 4 days after stopping.
279	It did not do a lot for the anxiety initially, but I only took 3)  The blood pressure issue, however, was enough to make my psychiatrist encourage me to stop.
280	less libido, tired always, sleep a lot, 15 mg, doesnt do much, little more relaxed about problems, maybee I go up to 17,5 mg or 20 mg and I will give it a try the next 2 months.
281	poor short-term memory, increased alcohol craving, increased reaction to alcohol/blackouts, vivid dreams, sleep disturbances (talking in sleep), weight gain (15+ lbs) and decreased sex drive.

288	"first day or two- felt ""out of it"", extreme fatigue, Currently (3 wks), I am having bruising, hair loss, fatigue, can't sleep through the night, increased anxiety when I wake, jaw clenching, and difficulty having orgasm."
289	Slight nausea and somnolence, 2ND Time .
290	Nausea; vomiting; suicidal thoughts; slight schizophrenia; tremors; increased anxiety; agitation resulting in violent thoughts; psychosis.
291	This medication orginally did wonders for my wellbeing and anxiety, However, I needed to come off it as it often impaired my memory .
292	I sat with my head over the toilet vomiting whilst slurring random words and throwing toiletries at the people who surounded me.
293	THIS STUFF MADE ME SOOOOOOO TIRED AND I CANT EVEN GET AN ORGASM!

298	couldn't stop myself from eating sweets.
299	This has subsided after a month or so, Constipation .
300	The worst side effect that I still expirience are: Libido is nonexistan.
301	Initially, a loss of appetite, weight loss in first 5 days, spaced out feeling.
302	After about the first 2 weeks, my moods leveled out, I felt mentally numb.
303	No matter what happened, I didnt seem to react.
304	I liked the feeling I had while taking it, but what made me quit was the sexual side effects and a 15 pound weight gain in 3 months.
305	I had an increase in Libido along with an inability to orgasm, Extremely Frustrating.
306	I am currently at 2,5)  I tried going up to 3.  and after 3 days felt like I couldn't stop moving, but was hard to focus so I did things like wash my kitchen floor etc.
307	Weight gain, fuzzy head.
308	Gained 20lbs in 4 months.
309	Took it in the evening and experienced nausea and drowsiness.
310	The following day had increased anxiety and restlessness.
311	When the side effects subsided I upped dose to 5mg., then 7,5mg.
312	Tried to up dose to the recommended 10 mg. but side effects did not seem to lessen with time.
313	The Lexapro alone actually seemed to increase my desire to just do nothing and want to be left alone.
314	Woke up in the middle of the night and couldn't fall back asleep.
315	Called in sick to work because I was feeling dizzy and nauseous, sweaty hands, decreased appetite, numbness in the back of my head, sore neck, keep feeling like I need to stretch, feeling disconnected, at the same time got a body buzz and an overall calm feeling.
316	Felt tired and slow all day.
317	For the entire time I've been taking Lexapro, I've had no sex drive, erectile dysfunction, and only three orgasms during intercourse.
318	I've only had a slight reduction in my ability to concentrate.
319	I feel like I've been chemically neutered.
320	"fuzzy ""high"" feeling, sleepy, can't stop yawning."
321	On the down side, I feel as if I'm in a fog.
322	I can still do my work, but I want to SLEEP and I wake up groggy.
323	It's not exactly a pleasant feeling and I hope that it'll pass, as I am not interested in remaining a semi-zombie-there are lots of things I want and need to do in my life.
324	I am taking 5 mg. Can orgasm easily so far (I've been checking), If anything, my appetite's diminished, But it's only been 6 days, and I expect things will change.
325	Irritability, extreme hosility if I went up on higher doses.
326	Lack of motivation.
327	Slowing of cognitive thoughts, constipation(mild).
328	Good drug in terms of lack of side effects, specially when compared to other antidepressants, After awhile, the drug just made me numb, I couldnt really feel anything, and there was a desire in me to look for stimulation elsewhere.
329	I bought this root stimulating shampoo, and a follicle stimulator cause my head felt numb, wouldn't take showers cuz i would feel numb afterwards.
330	If not for the numbness this would be a great drug.
331	sweating, not able to stay asleep through the night, dry skin and hair, constant licking my lips ( pill rolling) as its called, tingling body experience, ring in ears, headaches.
332	First week; high, Second week; good mood, headaches, chest pains; third week; break through depression and fatigue, fourth week; still very tired, Doctor upped dose from 10 to 20mg and now I'm dreadfully zombie like.
333	My brain is at a standstill.
334	Kind of a relief from racing thoughts, but scary because I might as well be in a coma.
335	I like not feeling depressed, but I feel like I am being made to feel happy against my will.
337	Jaw Clenching, Headache-seems to be fading, Worse Brain Fog than fibromyalgia alone, More Extreme Fatigue, loss of appetite control, seems no help with fibro pain, dry mouth, heart palpitations, urine retention?, edema.

339	I experience frequent headaches as well as insomnia-which has led to a mild addiction to sleeping aids.
340	Vivid dreams and nightmares.
341	Total loss of libido, Fogginess/Forgetfullness, Teeth clenching.
342	Anxiousness and anger.
343	I've also gained about 60 pounds because I became more depressed and freaked out, leading me to just give up on a healthy lifestyle as well as failing an entire semester at my university.
344	light headed and increased anxiety the first few days, then subsided.
345	the following side effects continue, sometimes more markedly than at other times: night sweats, excessive yawning, decreased sex drive, weight gain, vivid dreams, insomnia.

347	Dizziness, Dry mouth, Yawning.
348	All left after a couple of weeks, Erectile disfunction.
349	Inability to orgasm.
350	Lack of sexual desire.
352	However the inability to orgasm has been addressed by use of a prostate massager which works well despite being embarrassing.
353	I'm slowly beginning to have erections again so I expect that eventually the orgasm inability will resolve itself.
355	This dosage made me very sleepy about 5 hours after taking it.
356	I would yawn constantly and uncontrollably.
357	The sleepiness disappeared, However, I have problems ejaculating.
358	And while I am now very slow to anger, I am slow very slow to excite.
359	My emotions feel muted, and my former compulsiveness is replaced with listlessness.
360	I am not depressed, but I feel that life is without excitement.
361	"weight gain, spaced-out/zombie-like/""dream""-like feeling, sweating, increased appetite, sleep too deep."
362	The reason is weight gain.
363	I've gained 10 lb of pure fat in the past year, Literally FAT.
364	I exercise, I eat healthy, Although, 4 months ago I quit smoking/drinking alcohol, after that I'm craving food all the time, mostly sweets.
365	Sweating for the first 7-8 months was AWFUL.
366	I felt on fire.
367	I'd sweat so much, I had to change my clothes a few times a day.
368	Sometimes I feel zombie-like, like life is out of focus.
369	I have vivid dreams, but I always had them & I enjoy them.
370	The draw back is sometimes my life is so dream-like, while my dreams are so life-like, that I constantly confuse what I dreamed & what I lived.
371	Sometimes I sleep so deep, that I can't even wake up to use the bathroom.
372	I'm so drowsy, I walk as if had 5 bottles of vodka.
373	Gain weigth & low sexual drive.
374	I ahve taken this medication for many years and I have gain weith (about 10 LBS) and the worst part is that despite that I work out 5 times per week I havenot being able to loose weight, Also, my sexual drive is very low, problem with erection.
375	Difficulty climaxing!
376	Weight gain, decreased enthusiam/energy to do things.
377	Hard to be motivated, Increased appetite.
378	Now I am trying to get off of the meds (pretty rough) to alleviate the negative side effects and return to a more natural state.
379	1)  Strong headaches for the first 1-2 months, 2)  Interest in sex has decreased significantly (50-75%).
380	Dry mouth, some sleepiness and excessive yawning.
381	Any side effects were , for me, tolerable compared to the benefits.
382	At first: Headache, nausea, trembling belly, loss of appetite, nervousness (All went away in a few weeks.).
383	I am, however, TIRED!

399	I have gained weight.
400	possibly a bit of lower back pain.
401	incredible drowsiness .
402	napping many times a day for extended periods, night sweating.
403	Lexapro has been great as far as balancing out my mood, and making me feel much less anxious and happy overall, However, the drowsiness is becoming a pretty big problem, especially when I am sleeping an average of 12 hours a day (mostly in 4-5 hour naps).
404	Night sweating happens about twice a week, and is a pretty small side effect.
405	low sex drive, weight gain, headache, irritable bowel, fatigue, spaciness.
406	love my husband but just do not feel like having sex very often, I can go sexless for months!
407	helps me in my job which is high energy and high stress, headaches can be debilitating and twice I had to be picked up from work because the headaches came on so strong I couldn't drive myself home
408	Hair loss!, rashes, sexual loss.
409	I was very suicidal when put on Lexapro and it helped me relax a great deal, I was so much more happy on it but had to stop taking it due to it causing hair loss and it killed my sex drive and feeling.
410	I did act like a jerk on it as well a few times.
411	Although if it wasn't for the hair loss and sexual side effects I would of stayed on it.
412	Nausea on the first day, nightmares, racing heart, unable to have orgasm.
413	Even with all the side effects I really think Lexapro is the right choice for me.
414	Severe night sweats.
415	Helped with depression after postpartum but I am considering trying to stop due to severe night sweats & cost of Lexapro.
416	Dry mouth, subsidized sex drive, first few weeks experienced tiredness and felt very foggy.
417	My benefits definitely outweigh the side effects
418	Dry mouth the first month and then later bouts of extreme thirst, I think it also gives me headaches and neckaches, but I am not sure because I was diagnosed with migraines previous to this medicine.
419	I've tried quite a few antidepressants and this one seems to be the one that handles my depression and I can live with the side effects.
420	Dizziness, nausea, headache, foggy, loss of appetite, weight loss, increased irritability and anger,

434	No libido whatsoever, Emotionless.
435	It helped my depression tremendously, but sexual side effects are severe in my case.
436	Nausea, stomach upsets.
437	Possible side affect was reduced sexual desire, but my doctor said this could be just from the depression and stress itself.
438	nausea, loss of appetite, trouble sleeping.
439	The side effects got better after 2 months.
440	Then I got lazy and wasn't consistent about taking it and whenever I tried to take it again I'd deal with horrible nausea, so I weaned off.
441	I'm dealing with mild nausea but feel the calming affects.
442	When my side effects are difficult to deal with, I remember that a debilitating major depressive episode, wanting to curl up and die, is FAR worse and I am thankful that I have options to help me live a normal life.

447	I had alot of dizziness and it was so bad I felt like passing out every time I yawned  (Sounds weird I Know).But that eventually stopped.
448	It also killed sex drive.
449	"It was distressing at first but within a few weeks my sex drive worked again,but at a much more ""normal"" rate,which I greatly appreciate, I feel I was to horny before."
450	I have had some weight gain,however my weight normally changes based on the time of year.

469	I went to sleep, then woke up a couple hours later feeling extremely nauseous.
470	All of the sudden a hot flash shot throughout my body, my heart skipped several beats, and I felt like I was going to die for a minute.
471	I gradually calmed down and sweated profusely, That said, Lexy ain't all bad.
472	My emotional range might be a little muted (I don't cry nearly as much), but I still feel like myself.

479	Within a few days of starting lexapro oh my god the dreams are vivid, intense, long, and complex!
480	And I can remember every detail of them when i wake up in the morning.

490	Stomach discomfort, initially some night sweats, jaw clenching.
491	The most immediate side-effect noticed was extreme stomach discomfort.
492	It's not like a sore stomach, but it feels like your abdomen is tensed up, which I initially mistook for a sign of additional anxiety, However, according to my doctor this tension in the stomach area is purely a chemical reaction to the medicine and not connected with an emotional state.
493	This stomach discomfort has faded about 75%, as my body acclimates to the drug.

508	Mild sleeplessness, unsatisfying yawns that went away after a month or so.
509	What I hate most though is the clenching of the jaw, That hasn't gone away, Overall, I'm happy with Lexapro.
510	I'm relieved to see that a lot of you are reporting clenching of the jaw.

548	I was social, but that night woke up at 2:15 sweating and in a terrible panic attack(not from a dream) but heart racing, swallowed breath, felt emotionally traumatized.

714	My head was in an unbelievable fog.

728	I take them at night with Trazadone for insomnia.
729	Headache, dry mouth, dizziness, chronic fatigue, increased appetite, stiffed jaw, decreased libido, weight gain, brain fog.
730	Zoloft did help with my anxiety but the side effects were just to much to handle to the point that I would rather live with anxiety than to live with these ugly side effects.
731	The side effects got stronger and stronger as I felt brain fog, chronic fatigue and all those other side effects I mentioned on a daily basis.
732	I would also wake up in the mornings drained out feeling dizzy, making it real hard for me to get ready and go to work.
733	I also gained like 7lb while on zoloft.
734	can't stop eating.
735	Hungry all the time, Tired, Can't get out of bed, More irritable.
736	Shortly after taking this medication I would get severe stomach cramps that would last a few minutes.
737	I also had the desire to drink alcohol heavily and got really drunk really fast.

751	I know Zoloft works for a lot of people, but I am breastfeeding and have a 2-year-old to look after, so I can't keep taking it in the hope that the side effects might go away after a week or 2)  I need to be able to eat and function.
752	zomby-like emotionlessness.
753	I felt dead on this stuff.
754	but I wasn't anything positive either, just BLAH.
755	I had no reactions, no emotions, no laughter, nothing.
756	had a very strange reaction to this drug, one which some people also seem to experience.
757	I got very speedy and high off of this drug in addition to feeling standard SSRI effects.
758	"The ""speed"" side effect was very unusual, and I could see it casuing addiction in some people."
759	"Dizziness, loss of appetite (initially), ""staring into space""."
760	When I first starting retaking it, I had no appetite for about 2 months, but that went away.

764	I am still dizzy but a little better I also find that I will sometimes zone out.
765	big weight gain!
766	no sex drive at all.

768	i hope i can lose the weight and regain my libido.
769	Side effects only lasted for a week.
770	Now im 28 and it gave me restless leg syndrome, paranoia, anxiety and I craved sweets constantly.
771	severe migraines, extremely low sex drive, mania, excitability, difficulty sleeping, weight gain, rapid thinking.
772	i think there are better drugs out there now to treat anxiety and depression, this drug has far too many side effects for anyone to feel comfortable taking it.
773	hands shake, memory isnt as good. 
774	Headaches, mood swings, grinding teeth, feeling low, loss of concentration,anger, suicidal and omicidal thoughts.
775	I started taking it at 100mg and then went on 50mg due to headaches I was also using endep 50mg for insomnia and pain.
776	No sex drive.

781	Medicine would stop working and I'd have to up the dose, anything above 25 MG and the side effects start to very badly effect my life.
782	weight gain,agitation,hair loss,sleep disturbance. 
783	completely destroyed what was left of my sex drive (and almost my marriage).
784	Also helped me gain over 40 lbs that won't come off no matter what I do.
785	Chronic constipation, too.
786	Don't like that feeling of not caring about anything, though, good or bad.
787	Lack of sex drive, no orgasms.
788	Weight loss.
789	Sweats.
790	First 2 days had loose stools.
791	This morning my jaw felt tight and then I suddenly was hit with an overwhelming feeling of panic.
792	My heart was racing, skin tingling, and even oddly numb.
793	Basically felt very very strange.
794	Initially - zombie like feeling, no emotions, intense yawning; Ongoing - extreme fatigue, ZERO sex drive, chills (that is  feeling like someone is walking over my grave.
795	not cold chills), TMJ (from clenching jaw at night).
796	However, after a few months, I feel like all I want to do is drink.
797	It seems like I've become an alcoholic since starting Zoloft.
798	I have NO sex drive and am always tired.
799	I also get bouts of suicidal thoughts.
800	Lack of sexual desire, harder to reach orgasm.
801	Helped with depression but total lack of desire for sex

807	It made my RLS 4xs worse.
808	Also my sex drive went from brooooom brooom to put put if any.
809	In the first couple of weeks I had SEVERE drymouth and hated that.
810	"I find that I am constantly clenching my jaw and it feels ""funny"" when I yawn or smile."
811	I also feel very, very groggy in the mornings and have to force myself out of bed, but once I'm up, the grogginess fades pretty quickly and I actually have energy throughout the day.
812	The only side effect I've had is it has completly shut down my sex drive.
813	MAJOR head pressure, dizziness, moodiness, agitation, no patience, insomnia, suicidal thoughts.
814	The depression lifted a bit but the anxiety, head pressure, dizziness, insomnia were unbearable.
815	Then the doctor increased it to 150 mg which made the head pressure worse so I slowly got back down to 100mg.
816	I am still feeling head pressure which is causing my moodiness but the doctor doesn't believe me.
817	If this head pressure will go away, I think I would be able to cope much better.
818	I guess I'll wait to see if this head pressure will ever go away.
819	The first couple of days I noticed slight dizziness within an hour or so of taking it but it resolved itself.
820	Dry mouth also for the first few days.
821	Insomnia was horrid the first 2-3 days, not sleeping but 2-3 hours each night.
822	Other than that, nothing - until week 3 when I all of the sudden experienced moderate nausea/vomiting and pretty good dizziness constantly.
823	weight loss in the 3 weeks I took it.
824	Decreased appetite.
825	I started low, 25 mg's the first 7 days, then increased to 50)  The first couple of days were rough with the insomnia but when that cleared up I felt fine, like I wasn't taking anything.
826	It wasn't until the 3rd week that I started to feel as though I had the flu.
827	Well, this lasted for 7 full days and I stay home with my 3 small children, it wasn't working!
828	No nausea/dizziness like I experienced yesterday and the 7 days prior.
829	I really wanted this to work and I do think it mellowed me out a bit, I wasn't so on edge, so jumpy and moody and irritable.
830	I just can't go on indefinitely feeling like I was going to fall over or vomit all day.
831	Tired, dry mouth, dizziness on occassion.
832	no orgasm during sex.
833	no orgasm during sex
834	was very tried until I started taking concerta for add.
835	I have gained 15 lbs in about 3 months.
836	I think due to the fact the zoloft has numbed any feeling of guilt of what I'm eating.
837	Also I had a very slow metab.
838	Lack of ability to obtain erection (before taking, it was almost as if I could just think about something sexual to obtain erection, now my girlfriend and I both need about 10 minutes of heavy passionate kissing to even get horny (she is also on Zoloft now), Ejaculating problems, mainly sexual side effects.
839	Bad sexual side effects.
840	sweating, dry mouth, increased anxiety.
841	dry mouth, increased sweating, sexual problems (libido and ability).

845	Reading through this yes the side effects have been awful and pretty persistent but I'll now explain below.
846	with zoloft of 50mg then 100 mg, I experienced a decreased sex drive- and inability to have orgasm.
847	more tiredness and irritable when I had to get up.
848	monotone in emotion.
849	I felt like I existed- monotone.
850	nothing was funny and nothing made me too upset either.
851	just shrug my shoulders as my living room curtains caught fire from melted heater wire that sparked.
852	Loss of sex drive, manic episodes, trouble sleeping.
853	Although side effects were minimal, I started having severe manic episodes after a few weeks - driving 500 miles for no reason, not sleeping for days, etc Eventually I was taken off Zoloft and placed on Lamictal, which is now slowly reducing my manic episodes.
854	Zoloft helped balance my mood after about a month, but the mania made my life more difficult.
855	loss of sex drive, increase in anxiety.
856	feel like when i get upset it just makes it worse and i dont feel like myself. 
857	Vivid dreams, night sweats, extreme lethargy, decreased interest in sex, feeling emotionless, nausea.
858	I felt an almost instant change with this drug, but ended up spending a lot of time in bed feeling tired and indifferent instead of going to class.
859	No sex=no good, though.And you'll probably scare your partner away anyway after they realize that you've soaked yourself, your pj's, and the sheets through with night sweats.
860	After you threw up 30 minutes after taking your pill.
861	weight gain, extreme spaciness and forgetfulness, loss of vocabulary, lethargic, cloudy head, lack of concentration.
862	I'm tired all the time, have gained 10 pounds and can't think straight.
863	This drug has made me feel really stupid and I find myself at aloss for words quite often - simply because I can't think of the right words to use.
864	"for the first 2 weeks, ""jittery"", and tired in the day, but these went away totally, still sexual dysfunction."
865	Sexual side-effects, insomnia.
866	night sweats, yawning, vivid dreams (but not bad ones); the first week felt dizzy; slightly reduced libido but more difficulty in reaching orgasm.
867	I feel tired a lot in the middle of the day but I always have in the winter anyway!
868	Sex is still enjoyable but it's harder to climax, which is annoying, but I think is getting better with time.
869	It has really helped for symptoms of depression and with less side affects than I was afraid of.
870	stayed awake for the first week or so.
871	Absolutely no libido!  
872	Dry mouth.
873	At first nausea,diareah,shakiness, sleeplessness, brain zaps, muscle twitches, jaw tightness, vivid/scary dreams,loss of sex drive.
874	The side effects were like living a second version of my personal hell.
875	I miss orgasms, but I like the person I am now a lot better than I was.
876	WEIGHT GAIN!
877	allot of weight gain.
878	"You will end up with a light headed feeling and what I call ""trailers' meaning that it takes your eyes a second to catch up with your focus. "
879	very low libido, no sex drive, intensified affects of alcohol tremendously, it relieved crying episodes, it helped me get my life back as far as enjoying things. 
880	Initially went cycling like a yo-yo with mild mania and depression.
881	It was stimulating and I was hyper for a few months.
882	It felt stimulating and made me hyper for quite a while.
883	At first I had super dry mouth and wanted to sleep forever.
884	That went away and then I had terrible problems reaching orgasm.
885	After 6 weeks or so my sex drive vanished completely.
886	My love life suffers due to the lack of sex but it lets me focus on other areas.
887	greatly decreased libido.
888	weight loss/maintenance.
889	Lack of interest in sex ruined my marriage.
890	Difficulty reaching orgasm, wierd dreams, weight gain.
891	I can still orgasm it just takes longer.
892	Dizziness, dry mouth, mild sour stomach(no vomitting), slight insomnia, weight loss, mild apathy, decreased sex drive, and fatigue.
893	I find myself able to fully concentrate, despite the slight dizziness and brainfog it gives.
894	I stated I feel apathy, but I believe its because I feel apathy towards things that used to make me sad and depressed, and anxious.
895	Even though I feel slightly numbed out, I notice I'm more relaxed than I have ever been-the brainfog does not interefere with my patient care and safety.
896	again I'm depressed and ho-hum not to mention I've gained 20lbs I wholeheartedly blame on the zoloft.
897	Nausea, weight loss in beginning.
898	0% sex drive, difficulty sleeping, nightmares, profuse sweating.
899	The nightmares and seeing things at night made me opt for another med.
900	WEIGHT GAIN!, WEIGHT GAIN!, AND WEIGHT GAIN.
901	The weight gain is the only reason I stopped taking it.
902	Brain fog, derealization/depersonalization, lack of concentration, hard time remembering things.
903	The first 2 weeks I had a headache, I couldn't stop grinding my teeth and I was a little restless but it all went away.
904	loss of libido, drowsiness.
905	I think it did make me sleepy because I was constantly napping, but that may also partly have been carried over from when I was depressed and unmedicated (I slept to avoid how I was feeling).
906	After a year or so I realized I didn't have much of a libido anymore and after about 2.5 years on Zoloft I finally changed my medication, but if it wasn't for that side effect, I most likely would have stayed on it.
907	weight gain and jaw clenching.
908	I love the effects of this med, except that now I am noticing weight gain (7lbs in last 2 mo.)
909	"It gets a ""4"" because of weight gain and how long it took to work (2 months)."
910	Jittery, clenching/grinding teeth, insomnia, lack of libido.
911	It certainly works for what I'm taking it for, but sometimes it can be very hard to handle the side effects I experience with it.
912	Severe diarrhea, which caused bad abdominal cramping.
913	Only had to stop it because the diarrhea never stopped.
914	only experienced side effects such as Nausea for the first week or two of taking this medication.
915	These are side effects that continued throughout treatment with the drug.
916	tiredness, increase in alcohol abuse/depenence (not near as bad as paxil), slightly decreased sexual desire(again not nearly as bad as paxil), somewhat decrease in energy, occasional euphoria.
917	This always made me a little bit manicky.
918	Now that i just started back on it, i'm experiencing the usual side effects when starting(tiredness, nausea, constipation, flucuations in mood and appetite, sweating).
919	sleeping a lot, low energy, sometimes hungry sometimes not, jaw grinding quite a bit, feeling ok then really down unexpectedly, sometimes not able to sleep until 4am, not much feeling down below, want to express myself and cry but can't, dry mouth sometimes, cigarettes don't taste as good, alchohol cravings sometimes, zombie like feeling but this improved on taking med at night.
920	Initially, some insomnia which subsided.
921	Long term: low libido, fatigue.
922	Memory loss, sweating.
923	I had terrible panic and anxiety.
924	Sexual side effects.
925	Virtually impossible to ejaculate. 
926	gained 5lbs, decreased sexual desire.
927	Really very few side effects-I think it's great.
928	None at first, but over time I realized 1) I had gained 50 lbs in the last 3 years, 2) I had anxiety attacks that I previously never had , 3) Restless Leg Syndrome, 4) Sweaty and HOT nearly all of the time.
929	5) Still had several months during the year when I was fatigued and too tired to function.
930	I stopped taking Zoloft because I was still having several months out of the year when I felt like it wasn't helping - I had no motivation and just wanted to sleep all day.
931	Plus, in the last year, I experienced anxiety attacks more frequently which slowly created phobias I never had before.
932	The last straw was feeling hot all of the time.
933	People look at you strange when you wear short sleeves in 40 degree weather.
934	Unfortunately, the side effects began to be too much for it to be worth it.
935	At greater then 50 mg experience sexual side effects.
936	Bad vivid dreams.
937	If I increase to 100 I have sexual side effects immediate.
938	Really can affect sleep.
939	Have many dreams, usually bad, that sometimes can not determine from reality.
940	Decreased libido and insomnia. 
941	Headaches & mild nausea for a few hours after taking it for the first few weeks.
942	Both subsided in a couple of weeks.
943	I experience some drowsiness so I take it at night.
944	For the first couple of weeks, I'd get headaches and have mild nausea after taking the pill.
945	But they came back after that - as colorful as before.
946	I read where others have experienced vivid dreams as a side effect, but I've always dreamed pretty vividly so this doesn't bother me.
947	I do still get the drowsiness about an hour after I take it, so I take it at night.
948	For the first 3 or 4 months, I noticed a slight decrease in libido, but at this point my sex drive is back in full force plus some.
949	weight gain that I cannot shake, but other than that it is much easier staying on an even keel in my PM week, and my family doesn't have to tolerate an anxious B**** who wants nothing but to run away during that week. 
950	Started w/ 50MG to build up to 100/day and during first week period experienced horrible side effects; tremors, nausea, etc After that week, no side effects whatsoever.
951	Only long term effect is that I can't cry - literally.
952	not that I'd want to be cry often but it is a good stress relief and now, nothing.
953	I can tell I get less angry at things and sometimes less sad - the only complaint is not being able to express sadness.
954	tremor (especially in hands), zombie feeling at too high a dosage, tiredness, lack of energy, numbing.
955	increased migraine and headaches frequency (went from very rarely to frequently), vomitting, nausea, initially constipated then just diarrhea, disturbing twitching while trying to fall asleep, not the usual twitching, very dry mouth, loss of libido ( got better when I decreased from 150mg to 100 mg after 3 months), also have occasional yawnitis as I call it which was worse in the beginning, also had terrible motion sickness I have never had before from flying, alot of dizziness if I forget my dose after just an hour since I decreased to 100mg a month ago, irritability, fall asleep at work sometimes lasting all day, somewhat better after taking the medicine at noontime, waking up in the middle of the night is completely resolved since taking the meds at noontime rather than before bed, definitely I am not losing weight, had panic attacks and that weird tingly feeling for first 2 weeks but these went away.
956	major weight gain that led to high systolic blood pressure.
957	Zoloft worked quickly and effectively at first, but eventually the weight gain it caused led to more depression (not to mention other health problems!)
958	No noticeable side effects until dosage was increased from 50 to 100mgs, then I noticed decrease in sex drive and increase in weight gain.
959	I love Zoloft because of the very few side effects and its effectiveness in treating my anxiety and depression.
960	Unfortunately, the weight gain and sex drive issue is driving me crazy, and I am considering switching to another drug because of this, but it appears that the other SSRIs have the same issues.
961	jittery, can't sleep, no sex drive.
962	It did help me with my depression and suicidal thoughts, but I have gained quite a bit of weight.
963	Night sweats (really annoying), loose stool (no big deal), difficulty reaching orgasm when i first when on, then it returned to normal for years, but in the last 6 months orgasm is very elusive again.
964	slight headache. 
965	Neck stiffness and pain, Headache, Muscle pain in legs and lower back, Difficult sleep.
966	Severe insomnia,weight fluctuations.
967	Once you eat a bite, you don't feel full and crave SUGAR.
968	Works for my form of depression, however it has destroyed my sleeping patterns.
969	Difficulty Orgasming, less of a sex drive, DROWSINESS.
970	It works well with both the OCD and the depression, but I feel numb: nothing seems to affect my mood in good or bad ways.
971	Very sleepy, would doze off at work at my desk and during meetings.
972	Weight gain.
973	VERY vivid dreams to the point of not really knowing what I dreamt and what really happened.
974	Helped the depression only quit taking it because it affected my job (the sleepiness) think it may have helped the anxiety, I remember I was able to cut back on my dosage of xanax.
975	vaginal dryness, decreased libido.
976	This drug has worked really well for my depression, and I feel is worth the side effects.
977	headache.
978	mild, a little dizzy at first!
979	sexual appetite went away
980	Loose stool, loss of sex drive, headaches.
981	little dry mouth.

985	some sleepiness.
986	little stomach upset.
987	Difficulty obtaining orgasim.
988	Anxiety increased tenfold, had panic attcks, disconnected/spaced out feeling.

996	jittery, sexual effects.
997	(of course, the problems i was having were causing those anyways) Now no side effects , occasonal headaches, and jitters, but mostly I feel much much better.
998	The only side effect I have noticed is it makes me sleepy, so I take it at night and sleep well.
999	I do have occassional, mild headaches but nothing worth stoping it over, that's why there's Motrin.
1000	About 3 months ago,I began to have symptoms- not so much depression but of mood swings, severe irratibility & anger.
1001	slight sexual problems, delayed ejaculation.
1002	Initially constipation but it went away after a few weeks.
1003	Over a 10 yr period I have gained 70 lbs Other than that, it helped me with my anxiety attacks and depression.
1004	Initial side effects included period tremors, mainly in my hands, that went away after I had been on the med for a few weeks.
1005	Ongoing side effects include nausea (if I don't eat something with it), sleepiness, and difficulty achieving orgasm.
1006	Am taking this in combination with Wellbutrin, which counteracts the sexual side effects and the sleepiness.
1007	Overall I am delighted with the difference Zoloft has made for me in letting me lead a normal life, and I consider a bit of nausea to be quite worth it.
1008	In the very first years, there was difficulty in achieving orgasm, but no ED at all.
1009	I remember the first four days on the drug were weird: I felt jittery and a little elated, rather like the opening to a hallucinogenic drug.
1010	I also didn't like the weird feelings when I first started so I took half doses until I got used to them and then moved to the full dose.
1011	any I had initially went away after a few weeks but the lack of sex drive is why I had to quit taking it.
1012	Some mental fogginess in school.
1013	Makes me sleepy.
1014	Equilibrium problems at 50 mg. dropped by to 25 mg solved problem
1015	For the first couple weeks I was very tired, felt lethargic at times and more anxious at others.
1016	I also had an irrational fear that this drug was going to cause me to 'lose my mind' or have some other horrible side effect that SOOO many people write about on-line.
1017	I have noticed i have the jitters and seem unable to concentrate fully.
1018	I am somewhat fragile at this moment.

1022	I had some fatigue when first starting the prescription, but I no longer notice it.
1023	Dry mouth, sweating, light headedness, but most of these went away after a few weeks.

1035	No sexual desire at all and terrible amount of weight gain.
1036	I am blaming the 40 lbs gained in a year on the meds because I was active and watched my diet.

1047	The first week or so I felt a little weird but once the medication kicked in, it was great.

1124	Short-term memory loss, shortened attention span, depression, suicidal thoughts, developed a stutter, always tired, nightmares, paranoia, extreme moods.
1125	After a few months, I started to notice it was making me become somewhat bipolar - on it, I was annoyingly happy and jumpy, but after two hours of taking it, I felt the same, and after two more hours, I was extremely depressed.
1126	I had also noticed that it took more to hold my attention than it used to, and I couldn't remember things that happened or stuff people said five minutes before.
1127	A little after I began noticing this, I started stuttering, and my stutter got worse as I kept taking the medicine, as did all my other side effects.
1128	Sometimes when talking, I would stutter, and forget what I was saying.
1130	"Never have I had such side effects, nor have I ever felt as ""drugged"" as I did on Cymbalta: nervous and speeding."
1131	The side effects were almost immediate.

1143	I felt horrible, my mouth tasted like metal and I could not sleep for days.

1171	I have aches and pains as if I have the flu.
1172	Fainting, nervousness, nausea, insomnia, sweating.
1173	I was prescribed this medicine to help with depression and anxiety, but the side effects are awful.
1174	I don't see how I can possibly function because of the side effects and I certainly don't see how I could continue on this medication any more.
1175	The first 2 months it seemed to be fine, then the terrible night sweats came,the headaches,dizziness, out of sorts feeling came.
1176	Since last November my tendons on both arms started hurting by the elbow, then came extreme fatigue, and heaviness And pain in the calves of my legs came.
1177	Not to mention the acid reflux, having bowel movements 5 times in the morning,abdominal cramping, couldent eat, no appetite.

1188	Because of the bleeding I had to go for a colonoscopy and have my stomach biopsied which showed it cause the lining of my stomach was inflammed.
1189	I was only on 20MG and it worked mentally but to this day, my gastro-intestinal system is screwed up.
1190	Cymbalta has the same adverse side effects of the other SSRI medications and then some.
1191	In fact, because of Cymbaltas adverse emotional reactions, the inherent inability to get an erection or orgasm that is more the norm in other SSRI medications appears to be even worse with this one.
1192	If that werent enough, it increases anxiety and thus has less value as an anti-depressant.
1193	Yet what was even more profound, I found that I was in a state of emotional upset at all times but wasnt aware of it until I stopped the medication 6 days ago.
1194	Bizarre sensations of profound guilt and regret about incidents from the past (childhood to adult), were constantly re-lived and extremely inflated to say the least.
1195	I found myself on the verge of tears at all times.
1196	To add to the constant emotional upset, I can now attribute Cymbalta to frustrating memory lapses and a dramatic compromise in my cognitive abilities which I had mistakenly blamed on my pain medication.
1197	turned into a raging maniac, i had nausea, cold/hot flashes.
1198	I felt out of control, & disorientated.
1199	Also, headache,crying, insomnia, and I can't tell you all the side effects.
1200	agitation; hostility; suicidial thoughts; increased pain; increased depression; muscle spasams in legs and feet; dry eye; increased blood pressure; heart palpitations; increased anxiety, etc Switched to Cymbalta because of claims that it helps with pain.
1201	Side effects were terrible.
1202	Reality is I became a zombie, robot.
1203	I didn't truly feel, or really care about things I had a passion for.
1204	Less anxiety and depression but less life.
1205	Just existed.
1206	Went through motions.
1207	sick of losing track of what I wanted to say, feeling of numbness, the constant need to sleep.
1208	I could sleep two days straight and still feel tired.
1209	I want to feel even if it is depression.

1214	I can barely walk up a couple of stairs without a deep burning and fatigue within my muscles.

1216	I sweated like crazy, I felt even more depressed than ever , I became anti social and my anxiety worsened.
1217	After the third day on 30 mg of this drug I felt like I was in a fog.
1218	I was completely depleted of all energy.
1219	It kept me up all night and I would sleep all day.
1220	The first couple days are hard for me to even remember what went on.
1221	Feeling this out of control is scary. 
1222	Nausea.
1223	Lots of nausea.
1224	Also, a marked reduction in sexual response and sensation.
1225	Also, spells of dizziness not associated with a change in position (randomly while sitting down or walking, not just upon standing up).
1226	No discernible effect on the depression after 8 weeks at recommended therapeutic dosage of 60 mg/day, at which point we decided that due to the already-present undesirable side effects, it would be a bad idea to try increasing the dose further.
1227	I had extreme anger and road rage.
1228	I literally screamed at a stranger over a parking spot.
1229	These behaviors are not like me at all.
1230	only took it 2 days; had horrible migraine, dizziness, nausea and ringing in the ears.
1231	I have stopped it and now on day 3 migraine is still with me.
1232	It is horrible to try and go off of.

1234	While that subsided, I then felt a progressive feeling of being in a general stupor.
1235	Lethargy, significant effects on short-term memory to the point it was affecting my ability to work efficiently.
1236	Brain zaps,dizziness, couldn't sleep,u name it I had!
1237	Irritability, sleeplessness.
1238	I made a suicide attempt while on it and it is my opinion it was the cause that pushed me over the edge.

1240	I had chest pain, heart palpitations, vomiting, headache, rage, mood swings, and more.
1241	Loss of appetite, constipation, tiredness, loss of emotional capabilities aka zombie, general numbness, lack of sexual interest.
1242	when I finally stopped taking this stuff after losing five years of my life to it, I now have joint pain that makes it difficult to do anything.

1244	nausea (at first), constipation, dizziness, NEVER sleep, always yawning and tired, very mean, hostile and aggressive when upset about something, very very bad night sweats.
1245	I have been on Cymbalta for about 2 months now and I feel like I am losing my mind.

1247	I have never been a physical person and I do not think twice to hit someone if I am really hurt.
1248	I am pushing the people who I am closest to away.
1249	After I have an episode I feel like I was drunk and have NO IDEA why I did it!
1250	Horrible insomnia, highly depressive and suicidal feelings, inability to orgasm, loss of energy, exhaustion.
1251	I took this medicine for about a month, and during that month I did not sleep more than 5 hours a night.
1252	I woke up at least 5 or 6 times every night.
1253	I felt weak and exhausted and unable to keep up with normal days.
1254	I took so many short naps, but nothing helped.
1255	My feelings of depression, which Cymbalta was supossed to fix, were increased and I found myself contemplating sucidial or destructive actions a lot.
1256	Another thing that bothered me, well a lot, was I was unable to orgasm.
1257	Overall, the drug gave me a bad feeling.
1258	med helped for a while, but I gained about 30lbs in the midsection.
1259	WEIGHT GAIN DESPITE REDUCED CALORIE INTAKE, frequent nausea, vivid dreams to the point that is difficult to wake from them, head rush that made me think I was having a stroke, disassociation, spaciness, horrible withdrawal symptoms-so NOT quit suddenly or on your own.

1264	Emotionally and sexually flat-lined.

1279	I am constantly forgetting words and always feel like I'm in a fog.
1280	I barely remember the last 3.5 months.
1281	I would sit down to study for class and forget what I just read.
1282	Cymbalta did not solve my sleepiness and just added many uncomfortable side effects.
1283	"I have intense sweating, sleep disturbances, feeling spacey and dizzy, sleeping 2-3 hours during the day because of ""brain fuzz""."

1293	After 3 days my tongue was triple in size and a dark maroon color vivid dreams weird and wild,sores on tongue,no crying,head aches were gone.
1294	I liked that it made me seem emotionally detached events happened that would normally make me burst into tears but with Cymbalta I was emotionally free.

1305	Fatigue, extreme changes in body temperature (hot to cold), slight headache, insomnia, agitation and anxiousness, fidgeting, food tasting odd and loss of concentration.
1306	The side effects are worse than the benefits.
1307	I was not prepared to endure the side effects for 2-4 weeks to see whether the drug would work or not.
1308	I can't see how it can be an anti-depressant when some of the side effects are depressive thoughts and actions.
1309	fatigue,irritability,lack of appetite(without weight loss).
1310	Started at 30mg and increased to 60mg Very bad fatigue Week#1 then a little less during Week#2, especially in afternoons.
1311	No impressive mood benefits, just drawbacks: the most notable was irritability everyday with a general negative outlook and being easily angered.
1312	Cymbalta made my nervousness and depression worse!
1313	Dizzy, light headed, foggy brain, just stoned!
1314	Exausted too!
1315	Dizzy, light headed, foggy brain, just stoned!
1316	Dizzy, light headed, foggy brain, just stoned!

1319	I cant stay home being stoned and exausted over this medicine.
1320	I feel sluggish,unmotivated,and still have depression,aniexty and pain.
1321	nausea at first only.

1336	Didn't cry at my own sister's funeral!
1337	Felt numb, robot-like.
1338	Also couldn't orgasm.
1339	Initially, lose of appetite, sweating, dry mouth, constipation.
1340	Once body is adjusted, only side affect is rapid weight gain.
1341	Gained weight rapidly while on this drug.
1342	The risks/side effects are not worth the inital relief.
1343	EXTREME sweating, flat feeling, anger, halo around head feeling.
1344	I think Cymbalta has made me extremely angry at everyone and has made my obsessive thoughts worse!
1345	heavy sweating.
1346	"heart palpitations, chronic constipation, legs weak and heavy, trembling, crying jags, irritability, once or twice a ""rage"" reaction, very low self esteem, feeling unsafe and insecure, unhappy and scared."
1347	Deep-end mania.
1348	I would take time off work to collect.
1349	I was also missing meetings!
1350	My career was at an all time low!
1351	I kept getting fired.
1352	weight gain (50+ pounds) high blood pressure skin problems tiny wounds would not heal for months, frequently developed into skin infections (e. g. from acne) immune system problems loss of interest in all activities loss of interest in relationships extreme fatigue wanted to sleep all the time could not feel happiness or joy continued to feel depression, have suicidal thoughts under stress .
1353	Nauseated the first week, then went away.
1354	Cymbalta makes me very tired and listless,which in turn made me gain weight, which in turn made me feel more depressed.
1355	I can't concentrate well,foggy thoughts,poor memory,and don't want to socialize much.
1356	I have a subtle ringing in my ears.
1357	Only major side effect was inability to achieve orgasm which I personally found intolerable.
1358	Had it not been for the one side effect, I'd likely have continued it indefinitely for Fibro Pain & Depression.
1359	Extreme sedation, inability to move, excessive sleeping.
1360	Digestive tract discomfort which has lead to a flare up of IBS.
1361	May be a good drug, but I can't take it anymore because of the sedation and stomach problems.
1362	Drastic drop in libido, profuse sweating, decreased appetite.
1363	The decreased libido is a major problem because I truly love my husband of 14 years, but I have a VERY difficult time being interested on an intimate level.
1364	I also cannot deal with the sweating.
1365	I sweat so profusely that it has become embarrassing.
1366	decreased appetite, nausea (went away after a few days), some sudden dizzy spells (last a few seconds to a minute or two), constipation, gas.
1367	"dry mouth, headaches, lowered libido, hot flashes, irregular sleep pattern (insomnia like), hitting ""wall"" - brain stops working, poor short term memory, fatigue."
1368	But I think there is a life cycle to taking it, maybe 5 years or so; when they increased it to 90mg (April 2012) my cognition got noticeably worse, fatigue got much worse, every side effect amplified
1369	INTENSE HOT FLASHES, PROFUSE SWEATING, particularly severe with stress and when too hungry - can get to the point of soaking, dripping sweat, soaked clothes, bed, chair, car seat, total embarrassment, happens worst at most inappropriate times.
1370	It seems only a VERY TOXIC drug would have this side effect.
1371	Now, after 9 months, constant dull (sinus) headache, constant insomnia, caffeine intolerant (1 cup coffee = heart pounding, headache, agitation, uncomfortable for rest of day), 3 months ago weight started increasing, now 40 pounds heavier!
1372	Isolating, fuzzy headed, poorer concentration now 9 months after switching to Cymbalta, time to switch back or on to another SSNRI/SNRI or hopefully, maybe, something better!
1373	Cymbalta, however, has decreased ability to orgasm much less than Effexor or Zoloft, Paxil caused much worse (totally intolerable) headaches.
1374	Cymbalta has helped with depression, but I've had better success with much less, unpleasant side effects from other medications, and soon I will be switching back.
1375	"complete indifference towards sex, inability to get an erection, severe pain in my right jaw, headache, nausea, an odd gag reflex when I yawned, insomnia, feeling of being ""strung out""."
1376	However, the side effects were too severe; I was taking 30mg I could not endure the total impotence and feared a permanent sexual effect, and I never once felt sleepy while on the medicine.
1377	Made me gain a quick 15 pounds.
1378	Emotionally numb, wasn't happy or sad.
1379	No libido at all, was unable to orgasm from sex. 
1380	The first week I was on it, I threw up every day.
1381	Lost 10 pounds.
1382	Other than that bad week of not being able to eat, no other side effects.
1383	Nausea and stomach cramping the first couple of days; was somewhat better if I ate small amounts of food frequently.
1384	It also made me very hungry when I first started it and whenever I increased dosage.
1385	vivid dreams, clenching of the jaw, dry mouth, night sweats, interupted sleep, needing the toilet in the night, insomnia, weight gain, craving carbs, binge eating,weak joints, muscle tiredness, emotional numbness- feeling of not caring about anything or anyone,loss of labido,itching,excessive yawning and tiredness, short attention span.
1386	since taking cymbalta i av gained 14lbs which i CANT loose no matter how hard i try,im also craving carbs & binge eating which iv neva done b4) i av also found that when training @ gym my joints r weaker & i av 2 wear supports.
1387	the emotional numbness as affected me most as im @ risk of losing my partner who as bin there 4me thru it all but i just av no feelings & i dont seem 2 care how much i hurt him,i also feel like ill lose my friends & family if im not careful.
1388	Catatonic, no emotion.
1389	Severe palpitations and irregular heartbeat.
1390	Stopped taking it and two weeks later still irregular.
1391	I was able to function physically like a normal human being again for the first time in years, but I had no emotion whatsoever.
1392	loss of appetite, weight loss, nausea (subsided after a few days).
1393	I was hit with a lot of side effects of Cymbalta.
1394	The loss of appetite and weight loss was one of the main side effects I had, I am already underweight, and losing weight isn't good for me
1395	definatly get real nausious.
1396	I am having strong flu like symtoms but I am coming off of effexor and that has always been hardcore.
1397	I have been on effexor for 11 years and it has help me funtion and provide for my family, but I have been really tired and have to contantly fight weight gain.
1398	Occasional dryness of mouth & constipation at first.
1399	Rapid heart beat at times.
1400	Mild headaches.
1401	Lightheadedness.
1402	Low dose (20 mg) One weird side effect I had was an occasional feeling of heaviness in my calves that gradually increased and became painful, almost like the blood was pooling in my legs.
1403	Still feel lightheaded now & then.
1404	constant numbness on the right side of my body, tingling fingers, unexplained extreme yawning, trouble staying asleep, anxiety, accelerated heart rate in mornings, dry-mouth when working out, new sweating that continues hours after working out, constipation, loss of appetite/cravings.
1405	I had lots of side effects the first 2-3 days of being on the 30 mg tablet, but most went away.
1406	4-5 weeks into 60 mg I started to have extreme numbness & tingling on my right hand, arm, side, shoulder blade.
1407	"decreased appetite, fatigue, maybe a little ""foggy""."
1408	And I'm 50 pounds overweight, so I'm not complaining about the decreased appetite!
1409	Short term: dizziness,nausea,confusion, and headaches for about 10 days or so.
1410	Long term: extremely graphic nightmares, night sweats(especially in winter), 30 lb.
1411	weight gain, sexual side effects, extremely unhappy with all of these side effects.
1412	I feel somewhat more stable than when off of this type of medicine, but I am also so unhappy with the long term side effects.
1413	Also, I am still experiencing some major depressive episodes and invasive thoughts, which makes me question if the cure is worse than the disease.
1414	have gained 30 lbs since I began taking this.
1415	I have never been overweight before.
1416	Also, oddly my cholesterol has jumped up over 50 points in the last year.
1417	Which can be a side effect of Cymbalta.
1418	Very sleepy all the time.
1419	Hard time focusing and if I miss dose look out.
1420	The drug has helped with the depression, however the side effects are awful.
1421	If you think giving a depressed woman who has never had a weight problem, an extra 30 lbs to carry around is a good idea you would be mistaken.
1422	So mostly the weight issue is a big deal.
1423	I swear the drug makes me very, very hungry.
1424	Also, I also just seem mostly numb which is pretty scary.
1425	Vivid dreams, and remember them in such great detail !
1426	Increased sex drive, reduced appetite,neck pain.
1427	I haven't been taking this drug too long and I am stopping because of the dryness it causes in my eyes (swollen) and my scalp (scratching).
1428	I can't read or focus my eyes because of the dryness and burning, my eyelids are swollen and, although it has helped somewhat with fibro pain, it's not worth it.
1429	Also, affects sleep patterns, I'm exhausted earlier, but can't sleep well.
1430	When I first tried Cymbalta, I stopped after a week or two because I was so angry, I was biting off everyone's head.
1431	Stopped and started again and now experienced this dryness.
1432	HUGE costipation, somnolence, loss of libido.
1433	insomnia, loss of appetite*.
1434	My mind raced at 100 miles a minute, but my body was exhausted, so sleep was slim.
1435	The loss of appetite I wasn't sure to attritube to the Cymbalta because I'm a finicky eater anyway, but I couldn't function with only 5 hours of sleep in 10 days.
1436	didnt want to eat first two weeks, cant sleep, felt sick when working out/shaking.
1437	then i was given 60 mg and i have been taking that for about 3 weeks now and i have highs and lows all the time.
1438	i either wanna go out or stay in bed.
1439	Sweating, hand tremors, racing heart, insomnia, bizarre dreams.
1440	"but at the same time felt completely ""flat"" emotionally."
1441	first 3-4 months I was doing great, then disrupted sleep began, waking up every hour, night sweats, craving for sugar, low motivation to do anything.
1442	I started on 30mg and went up to 60mg Couldn't tolerate 60mg, it rendered me completely sleepless and with metallic taste in my mouth.
1443	The cravings for sweets are annoying.
1444	I feel like a junkie.
1445	major constipation, weight gain, night sweats, excessive sweating (mostly face and head).
1446	I started on this and immediately noticed the constipation and sweating.
1447	My hair would be drenched by the time I got to work in the morning - even with the AC on in the car.
1448	Doc put me on something for that and it worked during the day but I wake up nightly with soaked clothes.
1449	I thought I could deal with it but after 4 months, I am feeling the exhaustion of not getting full nights' sleep.
1450	extreme dry mouth, to the point where I constantly felt as if something was stuck in my throat which would in turn cause me to have an anxiety/panic attack, decreased appetite, severe insomnia.
1451	Cybalta definitely helped with my depression but the side effects really took a toll on me after only a week.
1452	I had barely slept and had lost over 6 pounds within the first week because just the thought of food would make me sick to my stomach.
1453	I was constantly drinking water and had to have a bottle by my side at all times, it was just incredibly uncomfortable.
1454	Nausea, diarrhea, upset stomach, dry mouth, sleepiness.
1455	I have only been on 30mg for 4 days and have the extreme runs.
1456	Upset stomach and no appetite.
1457	started out on 60mg, which was a way too high dosage to start out on- lay on my bed for 2 days staring at the ceiling, not being able to move; also experienced blurred vision, nausea, excessive sleepiness, yet inability to sleep - Was so paranoid after this episode that I didn't take it for a month again, but t my doctor recommended that I rather slowly get used to the drug, taking 30 mg every second day, and gradually increasing the dosage - Second time round the side effects in the first week were minimal and even quite pleasant- had so much energy that I could get by with 4 hours sleep.
1458	This stabilised later on though - As I upped my dosage, my libido started taking strain though and I had trouble sleeping - At 60mg, I started experiencing excessive sleepiness, needing a nap at least once every afternoon.
1459	At 60mg however, my sleepiness just became unbearable.
1460	Needing a nap every afternoon just isn't OK for me.
1461	My libido also just did a disappearance act, which I simply couldn't handle.
1462	Nausea, vertigo and extreme fatigue to begin with (first week or so).
1463	Emotions were very flat for the first month or so.
1464	The nausea subsided but still suffer from the fatigue and horrible night sweats.
1465	Also very low libido and anorgasmic (difficulty achieving orgasm).
1466	dry mouth,insomnia,anxiety.
1467	Major constipation; fiber does not help.
1468	Confusion is really bad, lack of concentration is very bad.
1469	Short term memory loss.
1470	Loss interest in doing anything.
1471	I can sit for hours day in and day out with no interest in usual pastimes.
1472	I lost touch with all my friends because I have no interest in seeing them.
1473	was fine for the first month, but now I am experiencing severe joint discomfort in my wrists.
1474	Disturbed about the major joint discomfort in my wrists.
1475	I like the weight loss, but have also felt heart palpatations and have had extreme dreams.
1476	spaced out, difficulty sleeping, headaches(shocks), night sweats.
1477	For the first two weeks I felt very spacey and drugged, a feeling similar to taking extasy.
1478	"The only current side effect I have is the night sweats and I do get ""headshocks"" as I call them, if I forget to take my pill on time."
1479	Night sweats, constipation, taking longer to climax during sexual intercourse.
1480	nausea at first, which subsided after a couple of weeks.
1481	Still a bit sleepy during the day (I take it in the morning), but then frequent waking at night, with very vivid, weird dreams!
1482	I've gotten used to the side effects, and am sticking with it.
1483	very tired.
1484	head fog.
1485	felt tingling for the first 5 days.
1486	but I can tell when it is time to take it I get this tingling feeling,like when I turn my head my brain is a bit behind.
1487	On 90 mg I had sweating at night so that my clothes are drenched, somtimes multiple times at night.
1488	I also have had a lot of gas and some constipation.
1489	On 60 mg, I was irritated with my boyfriend when he wasn't being irritating at all.
1490	Possibly dry mouth (whatever that is exactly), drowsiness for the first few weeks.
1491	Unlike the other people on here, I haven't really experienced that many side effects, or really any that are any sort of bother to me.
1492	Feelings of a band around my head, memory loss.
1494	Some hair loss and some weight loss.
1495	These side effects are slowly letting up.
1496	Really I haven't noticed any side effects when taking it but a bit of sleepiness initially.
1497	at start dry mouth& metallic taste; started clinching jaws which causes headache, tooth and gum pain & neck pain.
1498	The dry mouth is very insignificant compared to depression.
1499	I am assuming the Cymbalta is the cause of the clinching.
1500	nausea, cotton mouth, and lack of appetite.
1501	Yawning, which subsided after a few weeks.
1502	Itching, which comes and goes.
1503	Vivid dreams, which can be rather interesting.
1504	Decreased appetite, which is rather nice.
1505	Diarrhea, which can be extremely annoying, but I am figuring ways to minimize it (taking it on a full stomach is helping).
1506	I do continue to have digestive issues with Cymbalta, but through trial and error, am learning to minimize this.
1507	dry mouth(first couple days), tremors(spasms), sleeping more, loss of energy, sweating, lost interest in sex because had trouble climaxing.
1508	"The primary ""side effect"" for me is a CONSTANT ringing (buzz) in the ears."
1509	Not sleeping, chills and fever, inability to drink alcohol.
1510	This is a very powerful drug and anyone that takes it needs to decide what is important, the drug works but it is a seriously strong drug and has many many crazy side effects.
1511	I only sleep a few hours a night, have chills, and feel like I am on speed or extacy, but wow, i feel so much happier.
1512	Decreased libido. 
1513	When taking at night, Cymbalta caused insomnia something awful.
1514	I would have heart palpitations and awake 3-4X a night.
1515	My only symptom now is sweating (clammy feeling).
1516	HOrrible migraines but i have had migraines since early childhood,This medicine just caused more frequency and higher degree of pain with headaches,Best medicine for depression that i had ever taken and worked instantly.
1517	I must say that i felt the happiest i had ever felt in my life except for the extreme migraines,Due to the frequency of the migraines i discontinued cymbalta ,wish i could go back on it.
1518	nausea/ weight loss the first month.
1519	Racing brain, not sleep well, dry mouth, sexual disfunction, bad memory, bad dreams, endless energy.

1521	little sleepy at first, then dosage was increased from 30mg to 60 mg after the first week & I felt better.
1522	Loss of appetite, weight loss, a bit of a headache about an hour after taking it.
1523	If you can deal with the initial side effects, which seem to subside, this drug is worth it.
1524	initial side effects lasted a week or so - bug eyed, dizzy, nausea - just like with any anti-Dep.
1525	The lasting ones: decrease in appetite, change in food cravings - from carbs to sugar - down 2 sizes :) this is a weird one.
1526	my finger pads seem wrinkly - like a person forty years older than me.
1527	Takes care of the sugar craving - i used to eat vegies lots and hardly any fruit, now it's reversed.
1528	SEVERE night sweats and increased sweating during the day, and somewhat difficult (but not impossible) to reach orgasm.
1529	"I had intense headaches for the first 3 days of taking Cymbalta, but then the depression ""fog"" cleared and I felt much less weighed down by my thoughts."
1530	During the first few months of taking Cymbalta (30 mg) I used to wake up at least 2X during the night to change pajamas & sheets/bedding due to intense sweating & was losing lots of sleep.
1531	Now I don't wake up until morning but I am soaked with sweat.
1532	some fatigue, some brief episodes of heart fibrulation, decreased sex drive, slightly less appetite.
1533	I would say my feelings are slightly muted, but in the normal range.
1534	Constipation, vivid dreams and restless sleep patterns.

1539	Often can't stop yawning about 3:30 PM daily for about an hour.
1540	I lost weight and felt great.

1543	First day nausea.
1544	"I feel happier, less ""blue"" I do have problems sleeping thru the night (I'm writing this at 4:30 am) but am hoping with continued dosage, that will subside."
1545	I have noticed decreased appetite and leg twitching (can't sit still).
1546	Hopefully these side effects will subside after a couple more days/weeks.
1547	One other thing is dry mouth.
1548	none of these side effects bad enough to discontinue drug so far. 
1549	vertigo, sweating, vivid dreams(though at times quite entertaining).
1550	I wish it didn't make me sweat more but it's a side effect I'll live with.
1551	Loose stools, gas, some fatigue soon after dose.
1552	Constipation (1200 mg calcium gel caps is a remedy), the first day I experience,d 1 or 2 hrs of nausea first day only, dizziness has been eliminated by taking the 60 mgs at night !

1554	I sleep at night, no nightmares and my dreams are , REALLY VIVID as I am a VISUAL ARTIST.
1555	A few times I have experienced theo peripheral shadows, 1 second, then gone but I now realize what they are and they no longer scare the hell out of me.
1556	I will accept the annoying side affects if cymbalta continues to keep the grim reaper, depression and anxiety, OUT of lifejourney.
1557	Oh, sex life; try a roller coaster ride to work you up to it .
1558	But I am so tired, all I want to do with my spare time is sleep and Now I am suffering severe anxiety daily as never before that I try to treat with Clonozpam.
1559	I am worried that the anxiety attacks will cause me to do something totally illogical and dangerous to myself.
1560	No trouble sleeping; had been on Ambien CR whiich had topped working, but now I sleep all the time.
1561	Jaw clenching, insomnia, excessive yawning, tiredness & nausea if not taken with food.

1577	hot sweats, regular powerful muscle aches, loss of sexual libdo, 40 lbs weight gain.

1812	I have not taken the effexor since Friday morning, it is now Monday and i am JUST starting to lose the anxiousness, not to mention the feeling of total exhaustion and loss of sleep.
1813	The side effects are easily found on the net, so if you are a first timer, be wary of the side effects.
1814	Gained 50 pounds when I have never been overweight in my life.
1815	Also had no sexual desire.
1816	felt like i was inside screaming and nobody could hear me, teeth grinding, sweating like mad, hot hot hot, weight gain, headaches and general feeling of tiredness.
1817	At first it was ok, and then once i got on the 75 mg a day, it really changed, nausea feeling, hadache, no sex drive.
1818	i felt as if i needed to be doing something all of the time.
1819	weight gain, dry mouth, decreased libido.
1820	Felt flat and no interest in life, Didn't make me any happier or less anxious.
1821	Side effects were awful - antibiotics for ulcers and ear ache, stomach cramps, period screwed up.
1822	intense increase in anxiety and agitation.
1823	seems that effexor caused an episode of hypomania with extreme anxiety resulting in increased depression; not a good mix for my condition; regime includes lithium (1500mg); lamictal (300mg); buspar (50mg); abilify (15mg)
1824	increased sleepiness, intense weight gain.

1830	trouble sleeping-still depressed.
1831	Lethargy, low libido, dont want to do anything.
1832	Overall stoned feeling, tingly sensations, confused, could not stop crying, dizzy and disoriented.
1833	These drugs really change a person, from their mood, to their personality.
1834	They alter your thinking, and basically just mask the problem.
1835	I would rather feel myself, and have anxiety than to feel like a zombie.
1836	When I whent fron efexor xr 75 to 150 inmeditely i start feeling very warm in the stomag and sleppless in about three weeks after I en up in the emmergency room with 57 of hemoglobin concentration out of 135 they have to give me 4 bags of blood and I stayed there for three days, during those days I did not take the efexor but on the fourth day when I came out of the hospital I was feeling very dizzy so I took the efexor again with food in the morning and later I eat two kiwis and I felt so much pain in the ulcer caused by efexor that I had to drink a lot of milk to calm down the horrible pain.
1837	I have never had stomacal problems prior to efexor until now so I am goin to stop taking it but taping it down I let you know how I recover from my ulcer and the other side effects.
1838	Sleepiness Dizziness Constipation Raised blood pressure Fatigue
1839	Over the course of months I gained 20 pounds, tried to get off the meds 3 times had had such awful side effects, electric shocks through body, blurred vision, major headaches.
1840	I confused the awful side effects for feeling more depressed & more anxious, so my doctor upped my dose.
1841	Then I just couldn't handle the headaches it caused, so my doctor lowered my dose gradually over the last two years or so.
1842	Since taking Effexor, my life has been miserable, Can't sleep when I want to, can't stay awake when I want to, lethargic, dizzy, blurred vision, extreme fatigue, extreme increase in appetite.

1846	My inability to think correctly lead me to get frustrated when I tried to get work done, and also lead me to being more rash with decision making.
1847	Sleeping more did not affect my sleep schedule.
1848	In other words; I was up for less hours at a time.
1849	Weird dreams is honestly the only good thing about this drug for me.
1850	The amount of side effects sure made life even less fun than it already was.
1851	Low sex drive/cloudy head/unable to lose weight.

1866	Erectile dysfunction, delayed ejaculation, abnormal dreams, can't stay asleep,forgetting to eat, extreme nausea, headaches and reoccurence of ocular migraines.
1867	Thought most side effects would be gone.

1869	i started on 75mg and made my way up to 150)  i may have gone too fast though becuase i got numb in my face and hands with tingles that sometimes would move up my arms and shoulders.
1870	Yet i had vivid nightmares that were really horrible and i started to get night sweats real bad.

1888	weight gain mostly and i think my dose is too high, when i was first put on it it was just 75mg and i have gradually increased it to 300mg sometimes - now i think this high dose has caused me to have an excessive appetitte.

1890	It has helped my depression, but I hate the weight gain, and I have a constant feeling/need to eat.
1891	I won't off this medicine due to the horrible side effects, withdrawl symptoms and weight gain.

1899	Slight apathy and abscent-mindedness (I make lots of typos, etc).

1912	Experienced extreme carb craving, and bizarre urge to consume alcohal all the time.
1913	Currently at 225, I am very agitated, dizzy, lightheaded, off balance, emotionless, and one week after I started taking Effexor XR, I saw obvious daily weight gain, bloated stomache constipation, etc And then the financial shock.
1914	Confusion, inability to concentrate, lack of motivation, no sex drive, agitation, incresed blood pressure, chronic constipation, vivid dreams, severe sweating.
1915	On 225 mg This stuff just numbs me out.
1916	It's not that I am not depressed anymore, I just don't care.
1917	Impossible to concentrate, no desire to do anything.
1918	Totally removes sex drive.
1919	weight gain, sexual dysfunction, nausea.

1921	"I got the ""brain zaps"" that other people have mentioned."
1922	I definitely don't think the good outweighs the bad.
1923	The intial dry mouth and headache went away in a few days.

1927	weight gain, sweating, loss of libido, crave carbs - see additonal comments.

1930	Initially experienced loss of appetite & weight loss.
1931	I also experienced an initial period of emotional numbness by which I mean I didn't feel I was experiencing my emotions normally no matter what it was I was feeling.
1932	Now I find I have extremely vivid & bizarre dreams- some good, some bad.
1933	Sweating has definitely increased as well as heat sensitivity.
1934	I also found that after the initial period of appetite & weight loss, my appetite went back to normal & I have since gained quite a bit of weight.
1935	I haven't experienced any sexual side effects which is a plus but I am really not happy about the weight gain.
1936	not really my self sex drive gone sad things can happen and my tears arent there,my weight gain over the years (5 yrs) 60 lbs now im dibetic and my cholestrol is high in part from being so lazy now from taking this med tried to wean off and i cant do it the side effects are horrible dizzy,my eyes dont work right, nausea.
1937	right now, what I'm dealing with is the inability to climax.
1938	Can get very turned on but just no release!
1939	so far, seems to be helping keep my mood more stable but I do notice a kind of deadening of emotions- I know that was a concern of mine before when I took it.
1940	Dry Mouth,. 
1941	night sweats, very cool sexy vivid dreams, dizziness if I miss a dose, nothing serious compared to the good feeling I have when I take it regularly.
1942	Excessive yawning, with a euphoric feeling each time I yawned, very spaced out, happy in another world, no withdrawal, no weight gain.
1943	Wild, life-like/real dreams; definitely CANNOT skip a dose (wicked headache and dizziness).
1944	The 'broken sleep' however is frustrating.
1945	All that aside, at a remission-type dose (150 mg or less), if i don't start experiencing very unusual health affects, i intend to stay on this drug for a long while.
1946	It helps me immensely, and the side affects are tolerable, as long as i don't provoke them by missing a dose.
1947	dry mouth, anorgasmic At first, strange dreams, meaning very vivid and colorful.
1948	"Also, my appetite used to be more ""normal"" when I started, but now is back to more random eating/snacking."
1949	Even with the side effects, which aren't too bad and more just annoying, I can deal.
1950	Less and less libido and sexual function over the years.
1951	Made my drinking into raging alcoholism.
1952	Too bad about sex, alcohol and tobacco, I enjoyed them all ,but Effexor has really helped me.
1953	Yawning at first, no appetite, fatigue, no sex drive.
1954	Now that I've been on it for a while, I get random tics when at rest that aren't severe enough to really bother me.
1955	My knees shake a bit and my dexterity seem a little impacted going down stairs, but it's worth feeling normal again.
1956	I had pretty mild side effects at first, nothing severe enough to make me want to quit taking it and nothing out of the ordinary.
1957	Totally worth any of the minor side effects I feel now.
1958	Irritability.
1959	This is a great drug with minimal side effects.
1960	Only problem is this med makes me slightly irritable to sounds, sudden talking or disturbances ever so slight as they may be while I'm trying to work.
1961	There's a little bit more lack of concentration on my part which can be mistaken for short attention span because this drug puts me in a state of La La land and it's hard to snap out of it bc it's such a nice place.
1962	Pupils dialated, a little shaky, I started at a low dose and quickly went to a high dose because it wasnt helping.
1963	I had a little bit of a problem falling asleep last night.
1964	Sexual anorgasmia impotence brain zaps.

1967	Delayed orgasm.
1968	high cholesterol, sweating, decreased appetite. 
1969	Vivid dreams, lack of any sex drive, constipation, farting, some sleepiness.

1972	I also had dizziness and exhaustion, but those went away in a couple of days.
1973	loss of appetite.
1974	Initially I had dizziness and some naseau.
1975	I found taking it at breakfast reduced nausea.

1977	Most annoying side effect is delayed orgasm and sex drive reduction.
1978	Often get restless legs syndrome with Effexor.
1979	Loss of libido, gurning, tiredness, yawning.
1980	started on 37.5mg about 3 years ago, I am now on 225mg, whenever dose is increased I begin to have severe tiredness, sleeping for 12-16 a night!
1981	I also gain weight whenever the dose is incerased, and I have TONS of food cravings.
1982	Nausea, a lil.
1983	"brain ""zapping"" pressure, restless jaw (teeth wanting to grind) and HAPPINESS."
1984	Ive only been on it for 1 day and was a little naucious this morning and my jaw has been wanting to clench down.
1985	So I finally made to decision to start it and hope for the best and it seems like not too many side effects are going to get me.
1986	mild insomnia, poor interactions with alcohol.
1987	After a year or so on this I had more spinal problems and related nerve pain.
1988	I have lots of neck problems (DDD, herniation, stenosis, etc) so I thought the severe pain in my hands and arms was the result of that.
1989	It helped keep migraines at bay and I had tolerable, minimal side effects.
1990	"I had the ""typical"" brain zaps and odd brain feeling, dizziness, anxiety."
1991	During the first week I experienced hot flashes, night sweats, insomnia.
1992	My only continuing side effects are total loss of appetite and continuing problems with insomnia.
1993	The appetite is not a concern because I am quite overweight, it has actually helped me lose 50 lbs over the last six months.
1994	When I increase the dose to 75mg I experience vivid dreams, interrupted sleep, anxiety, irritability and unwarranted anger.
1995	nausea, tremor. 
1996	Terrible night sweats (most nights), non-existent libido, concentration difficulties, unbearable discontinuation syndrome if I miss a tablet.
1997	My moods are stable, but I'm now mildly and continuously depressed because of the two main side effects - lack of libido and bad night sweats.
1998	It's ruining my relationship, and so I'd really like to get off it but am terrified due to the side effects, and not knowing what I'll be like when I'm off it.
1999	It has made my life bearable, but introduced new problems which I never had before.

2005	The initial side effects are terrifying but thankfully past experience told me to
2006	While I have been on Effexor, I have identified side effects like asexuality - also, other sexual side effects; including: Ejaculation problems, and reduced climax intensity.
2007	There are also more mild effects on my sleep - Night sweats, and vivid dreaming.
2008	No real side effects besides a little more lethargy/sleepiness than usual.

2025	I found that if I took it in the morning, I would get very tired after about 6 to 8 hours.
2026	NO sex drive, severe fatigue, sweating, mild jaw clenching.
2027	However, the side effects are awful, but to me it's worth it because after trying Lexapro, Wellbutrin, and Zoloft, this is the only thing that makes me feel better.
2028	I have to take Adderall XR in combination with the Effexor just to keep me awake during the day because if i don't, i absolutely can't function; I will literally just sleep all the time, to the point where it truly can disrupt my life at times.
2029	I had never experienced a fatigue like that before, and it can be very dibilitating.
2030	I have absolutely NO sex drive, but that didn't happen until about a year ago.
2031	I wake up a lot in the morning with my jaw feeling tired and aching, and it never even occured to me that it may have been because of the Effexor (until i came upon this site!).

2034	Felt a bit sluggish, but after a month or so on the 150mg dose, have overcome that side effect.
2035	The one and ONLY complaint is this horrible taste in my mouth- tastes metallic, and bitter, a secretion under my toungue.
2036	For a week, I had horrible suicidal thoughts and mood swings, which eventually went away.
2037	few side effects at first, but now, after about months on the stuff, at about 20 hours after last dose, I start to get wierd feelings.
2038	"ALmost shakey, or tremors, but they are ""below the surface"" rather than something visible."
2039	More like I feel as though I am vibrating.
2040	Sometimes ringing in my ear, or lightheadedness.

2057	I started out taking 300 mg of Effexor and am now down to 150 mg At 300, I had very bothersome night sweats.
