22|The vertigo is rendering me unable to function in daily life causing me to lose work.
23|I am seeing a specialist for the vertigo and undergoing testing which now I have been diagnosed with vestibular neurontitis.
24|My vertigo has not responded to conservative treatment thus far.
25|Muscle spasms, muscle twitching, muscle soreness, insomnia, mental confusion, flush, brain zaps.
26|I took Lexapro for 3 days in 10mg doses and had severe side effects immediately.
27|"Im sorry this is more about not taking it than about side effects of taking it.
28	""I was given samples today and took one dose before coming to this site, where I learned that insomnia and decreased libido are serious side effects for many people; these are already major, major issues for me, By now, the first feelings of """"tightness"""" in my head, dry mouth, and a little bit of jitters have begun.""
29	As a result surely of prior conditions, but I do feel in part because of the drug or its jittery side effects, Ive been unable to stop weeping for the past hour."
30|Extreme Weight Gain 30 pounds.
31|Excessive perspiration, Erectile dysfunction.
32|Almost no libido at all, Utterly useless.
33|Took a while to have an effect on mood obviously,but side-effects alarming:sudden migraines which I had had very infrequently before.
34|Very big increase in blood pressure which I had never experienced before.
35|Have your blood pressure checked even if like me, you have never had a problem with it you may be in for a nasty surprise!
36|Heavy sedation, Jaw Clenching, Inability to organism.
37|Very bad side effects.
38|emotionless, Zombie effect.
39|Loss of memory.
40|"When i took lexapro i walked around in a ""zombie"" like state because i would never be happy about anything, but never really sad."
41|I just kind of felt numb toward all emotion, Also, my memory started lacking and i couldnt remember long periods of time or things i had done.
42|i still have difficulty remembering most of that year and for no particular reason.
43|Jaw jacking/clenching teeth, headaches, vomitting, waking up in the middle of the night for hours, increase in anxiety, blurred vision.
44|I started feeling the side effects the fist day i took 10mg.
